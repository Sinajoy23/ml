Under the Office of\\nManagement and Budget (OMB), Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and\\nAudit Requirements for Federal Awards (OMB Uniform Guidance), certain items of cost are\\nunallowable as direct charges except with advanced prior written approval of the Department.\\n2 C.F.R. ยง 200.407. OSEP has developed this guidance to assist State Educational Agencies\\n(SEA) and State Lead Agencies (State LA) in preparing comprehensive, approvable requests\\nwhen SEAs and State LAs are using funds under the IDEA Part B 611 Grants to States, Section\\n619 Preschool Grants and IDEA Part C Grants for Infants and Families. This guidance is specific\\nto the following three (3) common categories of direct costs for which SEAs and State LAs are\\nrequired to obtain prior written approval from OSEP: 1\\nI.\\n\\nEquipment expenditures (with a per unit cost of $5,000 or more);\\n\\nII.\\n\\nParticipant Support Costs (such as stipends or subsistence allowances, travel\\nallowances, and registration fees paid to or on behalf of participants or trainees (not\\nState employees); and\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nRevision of cost items within budget and program plans (including transfers among\\ndirect cost categories in which the cumulative amount exceeds or is expected to exceed\\nten percent of the current total approved budget).\\n\\nAdditionally, this guidance reminds SEAs and LAs of applicable prior approvals granted through\\nthe Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) October 29, 2019\\nFrequently Asked Questions on Prior Approval (OSERS 2019 FAQ Memo). 2\\nAll prior approval requests should be submitted to your OSEP State Lead.\\n\\nFor questions specific to other categories of direct costs outside of this guidance (including, but not limited to,\\nconstruction or renovation of facilities, rent, occupancy or space maintenance costs), please contact your\\nOSEP State Lead.

However, there may be instances in\\nwhich a PSC falls outside the scope of OSERS 2019 FAQ Memo or exceeds the $5,000 per\\nparticipant threshold. In such situations, the SEA or State LA must still submit a prior written\\napproval request to OSEP.\\nPrior Approval Requests for Participant Support Costs under IDEA\\nTo obtain prior approval for PSCs that fall outside the scope of OSERSโ 2019 FAQ Memo, the\\nSEA or State LA must submit a request to OSEP that supports how the PSCs are reasonable,\\nnecessary, and allocable. Requests must include:\\n1. A description of how the PSC will improve the IDEA Part B or Part C program,\\nspecifically, how children with disabilities or infants and toddlers with disabilities will\\nbenefit from the costs including the total amount of the cost (s);\\n2.

As with other prior approval requests,\\nsupporting documentation must be submitted, reviewed, and formally approved by OSEP.\\nAll other requests for prior written approval must be submitted at least 60 days prior to the event\\nvia electronic mail.\\nIII. Budget\\nAuthority\\nUnder 2 C.F.R. ยง 200.308(b), the SEA or State LA must obtain approval from OSEP before\\nmaking certain IDEA Part B or Part C annual budget related requests. This section addresses the\\nmost common budget related changes that OSEP receives but is not inclusive of all the related\\nrequirements (please see 2 C.F.R. ยง 200.308 for the complete regulation).\\nIn accordance with 2 C.F.R. ยง 200.308(f), the SEA must obtain approval from OSEP if the\\ncumulative transfers among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately budgeted\\nprograms, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or are expected to exceed ten percent of\\nthe current total approved budget (whenever the award exceeds $100,000) for:\\n1. IDEA 611 funds transfers between State-level activities in 34 C.F.R. ยง 300.704; and\\n2. IDEA 619 fund transfers between State activities, State administration, and other Statelevel activities in 34 C.F.R ยงยง 300.812โ300.814.\\nSimilarly, under Part C of IDEA, the State LA must obtain approval when it makes changes to\\nSection III of its Annual IDEA Part C Grant Application by making cumulative transfers among\\ndirect cost categories which exceed or are expected to exceed ten percent of the total approved\\nbudget (or ten percent of the total amount of the IDEA Part C grant award).\\n2 C.F.R. ยง200.308(f).10\\nAdditionally, under 2 C.F.R. ยง 200.308(c)(2), OSEP reminds State LAs that notification must be\\nprovided to OSEP when there is a โchange in a key person specified in the application or the\\nFederal awardโ as listed under Section II.D. of the IDEA Part C Annual Grant Application.\\nFinally, OSEP reminds its IDEA Part B and Part C grantees that prior approval has been granted\\nand is no longer required as stated in the OSERS 2019 FAQ Memo, for budget revisions for the\\ntransfer of funds budgeted for PSCs if an OSEP grantee chooses to no longer charge PSCs to\\ntheir Federal award after the initial approval as required by 2 C.F.R. ยง 200.308(c)(5)). For all\\n10\\n\\nPlease note that this provision applies to the cumulative amount.

Your inquiry was referred to the Office\\nof Special Education Programs (OSEP), a component of the Office of Special Education and\\nRehabilitative Services, and in developing a response, OSEP conferred with ONPE to fully\\nunderstand the inquiry.\\nIn your initial email, you raised three questions and, based on follow-up conversations, we\\nunderstand that you would like a written response to two of your three questions. First, you ask\\nwhether a child who has been identified as a child with a disability under Part B of the\\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), but for whom the parent has rejected the\\noffer of a free appropriate public education, must be counted when calculating the proportionate\\nshare of IDEA Part B funds that a local educational agency (LEA) is required to spend on the\\nprovision of equitable services to parentally-placed private school children with disabilities\\nenrolled in private schools in the LEA. Second, you ask about a Memorandum of Understanding\\n(MOU) that the School Board of Brevard County, Brevard County Public Schools (BCPS), an\\nLEA in Florida, is requiring schools in the Diocese of Orlando to sign in order for BCPS to\\nprovide equitable services under Part B of the IDEA to parentally-placed private school children\\nwith disabilities. We interpret your second question to be whether it is consistent with IDEA for\\nBCPS to require a private school to enter into an MOU as a condition of the LEA providing\\nequitable services for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled at that\\nschool.\\nSection 607(d) of the IDEA prohibits the Secretary of the Department from issuing policy letters\\nor other statements that establish a rule that is required for compliance with, and eligibility\\nunder, IDEA without following the rulemaking requirements of Section 553 of the\\nAdministrative Procedure Act. Therefore, based on the requirements of IDEA Section 607(e),\\nthis response is provided as informal guidance and is not legally binding. It represents an\\ninterpretation by the Department of the requirements of IDEA in the context of the specific facts\\npresented and does not establish a policy or rule that would apply in all circumstances. Other\\nthan statutory and regulatory requirements included in the document, the contents of this\\nguidance do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public. This\\n400 MARYLAND AVE. S.W., WASHINGTON, DC 20202-2800\\nwww.ed.gov\\nThe Department of Educationโs mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness\\nby fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.\\n\\n\\x0cdocument is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under\\nthe law or agency policies. Further, the Department responds to these matters, generally, and not\\nin the context of any specific due process complaint or State complaint that may be pending or\\nresolved.\\nRegarding your first question, the Department recently issued Questions and Answers on Serving\\nChildren with Disabilities Placed by Their Parents in Private Schools (Feb. 2022). The Q&As\\nprovide additional information regarding the consultation process including filing complaints and\\nare located on the Departmentโs website at:\\nhttps://sites.ed.gov/idea/files/QA_on_Private_Schools_02-28-2022.pdf. As addressed in Q&A\\nN-2 of that document, โ[a]ll children who have been evaluated and found eligible for special\\neducation and related servicesโnot solely those children who receive services through an IEP or\\nservices planโmust be included in the count to calculate the proportionate shareโฆโ (emphasis\\nadded). Therefore, any student found eligible under IDEA who is enrolled by their parent in a\\nprivate elementary or secondary school, 1 whether or not they have a current or prior IEP or\\nservices plan, must be counted when calculating the proportionate share.\\nIn response to your second question, IDEAโs mechanism for private school involvement in the\\ndesign and development of equitable services is through timely and meaningful consultation as\\ndescribed in 34 C.F.R. ยง 300.134. Consultation is an ongoing process that happens throughout\\nthe school year between the LEA, private school representatives, and representatives of parents\\nof parentally-placed private school children with disabilities. Further, determinations of\\nequitable services for an individual child, including the anticipated frequency, location, and\\nduration of the equitable services that the LEA will provide, must be included in a childโs\\nservices plan. 34 C.F.R. ยงยง 300.137-300.139.\\nThe responsibility for providing IDEA equitable services lies with the LEA. Services may be\\nprovided onsite at a childโs private school, or another location as discussed during consultation.\\n34 C.F.R. ยง 300.139. IDEA does not require that the private school administer any portion of an\\nLEAโs equitable services requirements on behalf of the LEA. IDEA also does not require an\\nLEA to use, or prohibit an LEA from using, an MOU in order to provide equitable services at\\neither the private school or another location. However, a private schoolโs declining to sign an\\nMOU cannot be a basis for an LEAโs denying the provision of equitable services to parentallyplaced private school children with disabilities enrolled at that school who are otherwise eligible\\nto receive such services.\\nAs a general matter, the Department believes that the terms of any proposed MOU regarding the\\nprovision of equitable services must be consistent with IDEA. For example, an MOU must not\\nprohibit the private school from filing a complaint with the State educational agency (SEA), as\\nappropriate. Under 34 C.F.R. ยง 300.136, a private school official has the right to raise\\ncomplaints to the SEA regarding the consultation process, including whether it was meaningful\\nand timely, and whether due consideration was given to the views of the private school official.\\n1\\n\\nSee Question and Answer A-1 of the above referenced Q&As: โThe IDEA Part B regulations define parentallyplaced private school children with disabilities as children with disabilities under 34 C.F.R. ยง 300.8, enrolled by\\ntheir parents in private, including religious, schools or facilities that meet the definition of elementary school in\\n34 C.F.R. ยง 300.13 or secondary school in 34 C.F.R. ยง 300.36.โ (internal footnotes omitted).\\n\\n\\x0cIn the Departmentโs view, timely and meaningful consultation could include discussion of any\\nproposed MOU. Any MOU that prohibits or limits a private school officialโs right to file a State\\ncomplaint under IDEA, or the rights of parentally placed private school children with disabilities\\nunder IDEA, 2 would be inconsistent with IDEA.\\nWe hope that this addresses the questions that you have raised. If you have additional questions,\\nplease feel free to contact Pamela Allen in ONPE at pamela.allen@ed.gov, or, in OSEP, Dwight\\nThomas at dwight.thomas@ed.gov, or Travis Bryant at travis.bryant@ed.gov.\\nSincerely,\\n/s/\\nValerie C.

In that\\nemail you asked that OSEP clarify the requirements under the Individuals with Disabilities\\nEducation Act (IDEA) related to the procedures parents must follow when requesting an initial\\nevaluation to determine their childโs eligibility for special education and related services.\\nSpecifically, you asked the following:\\nWhen a parent asks for โtesting because I think there might be a problemโ (or similar\\nwording), would this request count as an โoral request for an initial evaluation?โ If not,\\nis the LEA obligated in any way to provide assistance and explain to the parent of their\\nright to request an initial evaluation? Or, when the parent is having a verbal\\nconversation with the school and the parent asks a school to โtest their child,โ can a\\nschool stay silent about the parentโs right to request an initial evaluation?\\nWe sincerely regret the delay in responding to your inquiry and thank you for your patience.\\nWe note that Section 607(d) of the IDEA prohibits the Secretary of the Department from\\nissuing policy letters or other statements that establish a rule that is required for compliance\\nwith, and eligibility under, IDEA without following the rulemaking requirements of Section\\n553 of the Administrative Procedure Act.

This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing\\nrequirements under the law or agency policies.\\nUnder IDEA Part B, each eligible child with a disability is entitled to a free appropriate public\\neducation (FAPE) that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet the\\nchildโs unique needs and that prepare the child for further education, employment, and\\nindependent living. 34 C.F.R. ยง 300.101. All States and local educational agencies (LEAs) share\\n400 MARYLAND AVE. S.W., WASHINGTON, DC 20202-2800\\nwww.ed.gov\\nThe Department of Educationโs mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness\\nby fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.\\n\\n\\x0cPage 2 - Virginia Sharpless\\nan obligation to make FAPE available to each eligible child, ages 3-21, residing in their\\njurisdiction. To meet this obligation, States must adhere to IDEAโs child find requirements in the\\nPart B regulations at 34 C.F.R. ยง 300.111. Each State must have in effect policies and procedures\\nto ensure that all children with disabilities residing in the State, including children with\\ndisabilities who are homeless children or are wards of the State, and children with disabilities\\nattending private schools, regardless of the severity of their disability, and who are in need of\\nspecial education and related services, are identified, located, and evaluated. 34 C.F.R. ยง\\n300.111(a)(1)(i). 1\\nWhile IDEA requires every State to identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities\\nwho need special education and related services, it does not provide specific requirements\\nregarding the manner in which a request for an initial evaluation of a child suspected of having a\\ndisability must be made. In the absence of specific provisions, States may develop their own\\nprocedures, provided they are not inconsistent with, and do not substantially limit, a parentโs 2\\nright to request an initial evaluation under IDEA.\\nMany States utilize similar practices and procedures for conducting child find activities,\\nincluding specific methods for parents to make referrals for an evaluation for special education\\nand related services under IDEA. We are aware that States and LEAs often require that parents\\nsubmit their request for an IDEA initial evaluation in writing. Some States may further require\\nthat parents use a specific form to make an official request. Such procedures are often designed\\nto provide a simple and consistent format to ensure parental consent, establish the date of the\\nparentโs request, and for measuring against the evaluation timeline. While States may require\\nthat a parent submit their request for an IDEA evaluation in writing, because some parents may\\nbe unaware of how or when to submit such requests, additional actions may be necessary to\\neffectively carry out its child find obligations. For example, a parent may need assistance in\\nunderstanding or completing the required forms for a variety of reasons, such as lacking\\nresources such as a computer or internet access or having limited proficiency in English โ any of\\nwhich could substantially limit their ability to submit their request in writing. 3\\n\\n1\\n\\nChild find efforts must includeโ (1) children who are suspected of being a child with a disability under 34 C.F.R\\nยง 300.8 and in need of special education, even though they are advancing from grade to grade; and (2) highly mobile\\nchildren, including migrant children. 34 C.F.R ยง 300.111(c)(1)-(2). While addressed in separate provisions, the\\nrequirements for special education referrals and child find are closely related and need to work in concert.\\n\\nUnder 34 C.F.R. ยง 300.30(a), the term โparentโ means: (1) a biological or adoptive parent of a child; (2) a foster\\nparent, unless State law, regulations, or contractual obligations with a State or local entity prohibit a foster parent\\nfrom acting as a parent; (3) a guardian generally authorized to act as the childโs parent, or authorized to make\\neducational decisions for the child (but not the State if the child is a ward of the State); (4) an individual acting in the\\nplace of a biological or adoptive parent (including a grandparent, stepparent, or other relative) with whom the child\\nlives, or an individual who is legally responsible for the childโs welfare; or (5) a surrogate parent who has been\\nappointed in accordance with 34 C.F.R. ยง 300.519 or Section 639(a)(5) of the IDEA. Under 34 C.F.R. ยง\\n300.520(a)(1)(ii), a State may provide that when a child with a disability reaches the age of majority under State law\\nthat applies to all children (except for a child with a disability who has been determined to be incompetent under\\nState law), all rights accorded to parents under Part B of the IDEA transfer to the child.\\n\\n2\\n\\nStates and LEAs have certain communication responsibilities to parents under Federal civil rights laws, including\\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which are beyond\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cPage 3 - Virginia Sharpless\\n\\nIDEA does not directly address whether a State or LEA may completely ignore a verbal request,\\nbecause it was not in writing or did not contain specific language, terminology, or โtrigger\\nwords,โ or because it otherwise fails to meet a specific technical requirement. In the\\nDepartmentโs view, when these additional steps pose a substantial limitation for certain parents\\nto access an initial evaluation for their child under IDEA, the failure to provide additional\\ninformation or assistance could potentially violate IDEAโs child find obligations. Therefore,\\nStates and LEAs need to properly address a parentโs verbal request that can be reasonably\\nunderstood as a request for an initial evaluation under IDEA, but where additional actions are\\nrequired under State or local provisions. Examples of reasonable and appropriate responses for\\nschool personnel include: providing the parent with information and assistance such as a copy of\\nits notice of procedural safeguards required under IDEA; further explaining the right to, and\\nprocedures for, initiating an evaluation under IDEA; and, providing any assistance the parent\\nrequires to submit the request. Because the responsibility for meeting IDEAโs child find\\nrequirements rests with States and LEAs โ not with parents โ the evaluation referral process must\\nsupport, and not undermine, the effectiveness of the child find process.\\nOSEP encourages all States and LEAs to examine their rules and procedures to determine if\\nthose rules create barriers for a parent to request an evaluation of their child under IDEA. OSEP\\nfurther encourages States to determine if their child find procedures offer fair and equitable\\nopportunities for all parents to request an initial evaluation under IDEA to address their childโs\\nacademic or behavioral needs. 4\\nWe thank you for your interest in ensuring that States and LEAs have appropriate procedures in\\nplace to address a parentโs request for an evaluation of their child under IDEA. We trust that the\\ninformation in this letter is responsive to your inquiry.
